   <p> Changelog: <br>
<p> <br>
May 4th: <br>
<br>
- Fixed the activity messages <br>
- Fixed some typos and other bugs <br>
- Added a new command which can only ever be used by one person (and that isn't Shadowstar :x) <br>
<br>
<br>
May 3rd: <br> 
<br>
- Added the ability to change the bot's prefix using the d!prefix set [new prefix] command. Remember - you can always mention the bot if you forget the prefix: @Drunk o'Bot prefix <br>
- Fixed a typo in the d!botinfo command, and merged the d!about command. <br>
- Various other bugfixes <br>
<br>
<br>
May 2nd: <br>
<br>
- Added new command: d!botinfo that displays more detailed information about Drunk o'Bot <br>
- Added new command: d!privacy that displays our Privacy Policy (added yesterday but was too tired to post in here about it) <br>
<br>
<br>
New stuff: <br>
<br>
- Finally got this "Support Server" repurposed to Drunk o'Bot. You can type d!support to join (if you're reading this in the support server, then you're cool) <br>
- Made it so you can mention Drunk o'Bot instead of using the d! prefix. So, for example: @Drunk o'Bot help <br>
- Made the prefix and commands case insensitive. So you can do D!Help or d!Help or D!help and it'll still work <br>
- Added a very very basic d!slot game. When I say very very basic, I mean.. take all of your expectations and throw them out of the window- it's shit. <br>
- Added tons of new fortune cookie responses <br>
- Added more playing statuses <br>
- The Activity (random beer messages) system has been improved. Server admins can now choose which channel(s) they would like the activity messages to send to. Just use d!activity enable #channel or d!activity disable #channel to remove a channel. You can also type d!activity list to see all enabled channels <br>
<br>
That's all for now, folks! <br>
