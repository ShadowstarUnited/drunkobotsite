Drunk o'Bot is a unique kind of Fun-Bot for Discord. While simulating a general purpose moderation bot, Drunk o'Bot does not actually kick or ban anybody. Instead, it just has random funny and snarky responses to every command!<br>
<br>
The idea behind Drunk o'Bot came to me legitimately as an early morning "what if" thought. I was laid in bed; had just made a coffee and I was thinking to myself: "What if there was a Discord Bot that did <u><strong>NOT</strong></u> do what you wanted it to do?". And so I messaged syd about my idea<br>

<br>

Imagine a bot that does NOT do what you want it to do ü§£ I would call it AwkwardBot or something. Maybe give it some sass.<br>
<br>
a!ping<br>
ü§ñ I'm too busy not giving a shit to respond with my latency. Bring me a bottle of jack and maybe we'll talk.<br>
<br>
A different kind of fun bot that only exists for shitposting<br>
<br>
a!help<br>
ü§ñ Yeah, you DO need help. ...... what? Why are you staring at me? I'm not a licensed doctor or anything.<br>
<br>

a!ban @user<br>
ü§ñ You aren't paying me enough to do that, man.<br>
<br>
syd 04/10/2021<br>
HAH<br>

and do that<br>
<br>

Hold my beer, I will make it happen üëç<br>
<br>
Not only has it been incredibly fun to create Drunk o'Bot, but it has also helped me overcome a lot of depression. I would spend long hours each day just working on Drunk o'Bot, and it would distract me from my woes; as well as improving my skills as a developer.<br>
Seeing Drunk o'Bot grow as quickly as it did has been such an amazing experience for me, and the feedback I have received from the many Server Owners who invited the bot has given me the motivation to continue to work on it. Thank you very much <3<br>
