  <h1>About</h1> <br>
	
<br>
Drunk o'Bot is a unique kind of Fun-Bot for Discord. While simulating a general purpose moderation bot, Drunk o'Bot does not actually kick or ban anybody. Instead, it just has random funny and snarky responses to every command!<br>
<br>
The idea behind Drunk o'Bot came to me legitimately as an early morning "what if" thought. I was laid in bed; had just made a coffee and I was thinking to myself: "What if there was a Discord Bot that did <u><strong>NOT</strong></u> do what you wanted it to do?". And so I messaged a friend about my idea<br>
<br>
Not only has it been incredibly fun to create Drunk o'Bot, but it has also helped me overcome a lot of depression. I would spend long hours each day just working on Drunk o'Bot, and it would distract me from my woes; as well as improving my skills as a developer.<br>
Seeing Drunk o'Bot grow as quickly as it did has been such an amazing experience for me, and the feedback I have received from the many Server Owners who invited the bot has given me the motivation to continue to work on it. Thank you very much <3<br>
